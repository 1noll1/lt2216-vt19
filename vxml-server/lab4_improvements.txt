- Added option to start over at any time. I originally thought I needed to define my own script, which turned out not to be the case.

- Added "today" and tomorrow" as options to the grammar rules

- Added "step by step" option in case the application doesn't catch what the speaker is saying.

- Changed "You didn't say anything" to "I couldn't hear you say anything", since this includes cases where the application simply can't "hear" that the user is speaking.

- Same as for lab 1; "what date" is changed to "what date", as this reflect what the user can actually respond.

- I threw in some politeness. No one likes a rude robot.
